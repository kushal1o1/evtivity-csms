An OCPP 1.6 and 2.1 compliant Charging Station Management System for managing EV charging infrastructure. Handles real-time WebSocket communication with charging stations, OCPI 2.2.1/2.3.0 roaming, ISO 15118 Plug and Charge, a REST API for operators, and two React frontends for operators and drivers.

EVtivity integrates AI across the operator experience. A chatbot assistant answers natural-language questions about stations, sessions, revenue, and operations by calling API endpoints as tools. A support AI assistant drafts replies for customer support cases by gathering full case context. Both support multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini) with configurable parameters at system and per-user levels, respond in the operator's preferred language, and enforce security guardrails that prevent leaking sensitive data.

## Services

When deployed with the Helm chart, each service is exposed on its own subdomain via Gateway API:

| Service            | URL                                | Public Port | Internal Port |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| CSMS dashboard     | https://csms.your-domain.com       | 443         | 80            |
| Driver portal      | https://portal.your-domain.com     | 443         | 80            |
| REST API           | https://api.your-domain.com        | 443         | 3001          |
| OCPP WebSocket     | wss://ocpp.your-domain.com         | 443         | 8080          |
| OCPP WebSocket TLS | wss://\<load-balancer-ip\>         | 8443        | 8443          |
| OCPI server        | https://ocpi.your-domain.com       | 443         | 3002          |
| Grafana            | https://grafana.your-domain.com    | 443         | 3000          |
| Prometheus         | https://prometheus.your-domain.com | 443         | 9090          |
| API Docs           | https://api.your-domain.com/docs   | 443         | 3001          |

All hostnames share a single load balancer IP. DNS records for each hostname must point to that IP. OCPP TLS (port 8443) is provisioned as a separate `LoadBalancer` service for direct station connections using Security Profile 3 (mTLS).
