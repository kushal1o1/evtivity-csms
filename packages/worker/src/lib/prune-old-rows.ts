/**
 * Batched DELETE of rows older than `retentionDays` from `table`, comparing
 * `cutoffColumn` against NOW() - retentionDays. Used by both
 * `audit-retention-prune` (entity audit logs + authorize_attempts) and
 * `log-retention-prune` (operational logs) so the loop shape, lock
 * behaviour, and error semantics stay in one place.
 *
 * Returns the number of deleted rows. Errors are caught and logged at
 * `warn` so a single table's failure doesn't abort the surrounding handler
 * mid-loop; the caller is expected to continue with the next table.
 *
 * Batched via a CTE so a multi-million-row prune doesn't hold an exclusive
 * lock for the whole duration. Each batch is its own statement, allowing
 * reads and writes to interleave. The loop exits when a batch returns less
 * than `batchSize` rows (nothing left in the cutoff window).
 *
 * `retentionDays <= 0` (or non-finite) is treated as "disabled, skip" --
 * the caller-side check is redundant but kept here for safety.
