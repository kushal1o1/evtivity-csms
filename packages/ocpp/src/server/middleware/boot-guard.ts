/**
 * Per OCPP 2.1 spec B01.FR.10 (and the Pending-specific B02.FR.09): once a
 * BootNotificationResponse with a status other than Accepted has been sent, the
 * CSMS SHALL respond with a SecurityError CALLERROR to any CALL other than
 * BootNotificationRequest (or one triggered by TriggerMessage / GetBaseReport /
 * GetReport) until a BootNotification is Accepted. B02.FR.02 is the mirror
 * Charging-Station obligation ("SHALL NOT send" those CALLs), not the CSMS rule.
 *
 * The spec scopes this to the Pending/Rejected case (its precondition is that a
 * non-Accepted BootNotificationResponse was already sent). It does NOT mandate
 * rejection when bootStatus is null (no BootNotification has arrived yet).
 * Real stations commonly send Heartbeat or StatusNotification in parallel
 * with BootNotification because of WebSocket frame queuing — extending the
 * rule to null breaks interop with widely-deployed non-compliant firmware
 * without buying any spec compliance the OCTT actually asserts.
 *
 * Null is therefore allowed to pass through. The downstream handler decides
 * whether to act on the message; in practice the BootNotification CALL is
 * almost always the next frame and the session reaches 'Accepted' immediately
 * after.
